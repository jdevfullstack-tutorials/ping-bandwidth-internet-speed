# Ping | Bandwidth | Internet Speed
When I had my first stable Internet connection at home, I 
was so satisfied by the loading speed
every time I watched YouTube videos.
There is almost no lag and the download speed is more than
25+ MBPS. 

And then I played the online
Counter Strike. I realized I have a problem.
Casual games are no problem but
when a split-second fast action game is what you want,
you need to optimize everything, particularly your latency.

My company too has a great
and dedicated Internet connection but when I tested
it also with the online Counter Strike, things
were not that simple. I asked myself why I'm having
a very high ping when the Internet speed in
my workplace is more than 50MBPS most of the time?

So I really need to have that answer. 
And now I have the answer.

## Internet Speed
First of all, you know that when you just want
a quality experience watching YouTube videos
or NetFlix, all you need is a fast connection, right?

That's true. My connection here is a 25MBPS subscription.
It's not pure fiber, so download speed is faster
than the upload speed. But that's just okay.
I have my online class and things have been okay
for several months.

I was not noticing the importance of other factors,
until I played online Counter Strike.
So again, for just browsing and regular connection,
just knowing the Internet speed is enough. More
than 25MBPS download speed plus 5MBPS upload speed
is fast enough.

## Bandwidth
Bandwidth is when you think of the 
volume of data passing
through your connection: think of a road.
The more lanes it has, the more vehicles can pass
through at a given time.

So here is the catch: no matter how fast is 
your speed connection, say, your modem is being
used by so many people, it can only transmit
the maximum data it can handle. So it will 
result in a clogged network when it can't handle
all the demanding uploads and downloads.

This clogging will affect your latency
because no matter how fast your connection is,
if it's clogged, then you can't send and receive
data in real time, it will increase your latency.

Take note also that fast action games do not
require too much bandwidth compared to
watching YouTube videos, rather it is affected
by the clogged bandwidth 
because you can't send and receive
data in real time.

## Ping / Latency
Latency is how long (duration in milliseconds)
data sent will return to the device that initiated the ping.
Ping is the signal sent. In gaming, since ping
is a shorter term, mostly it will be used,
but the complete term is ping rate / latency.

At this point, several factors are involved. You 
can have a good ping but still you lag in
your fast action game. Conversely, you can have 200+ ping
but you don't experience any lag. All of these things
I experienced when playing CS online. And I 
was wondering why despite the connection being
so fast.

One is the quality of connection. You know, even if it
is fast, sometimes it's being shared by all users
in your home or all users in your certain area.
Another one here is network traffic, most of the time
when I'm testing in incognito a random search and
recaptcha appears, I know my connection is distorted.
At this point, data sent and received
will also be distorted, causing lagging
regardless of the ping. 

Another one is the connection itself. No matter how
fast your WiFi technology is, interference
will be there from time to time. Whenever I'm lagging
severely, I check whether the WiFi signal
is full bar or not, and most of the time, it's not.
If it goes back to full bar, I still lag because
my connection is now fluctuating. So better
use a cable, not necessarily the latest one, but
cat7 will do.

Also, as we all know, geographical location is very
important. For example, Malaysia and Singapore
are closer to one another than the Philippines.
If the game server is located in Singapore, then
this causes better ping for Malaysia and Singapore
players than the Philippines, now matter how good
the connection is in the Philippines.

Another one is your firewall and real-time
antivirus. You can simply turn
them off when you are playing. 

## Ping For Pro Gamers
As we all know, in CS:GO, when there is an
official competition, they will be playing somewhere
where they use LAN connection, 
not the Internet. This is actually a way
to eliminate the reason that you've lost the
game because of lag and bad ping, plus all
those setups that will affect your gameplay.

Now, I've been observing this at the Knife
Map of online CS 1.6, whether the 4 ping rate 
can be defeated by a higher ping like 50 ping rate.

Just to give you a complete idea, knife skill in
CS 1.6 is really a skill, it will require you
to have perfect timing before hitting, a 
split-second eye-hand coordination. Now,
in order to win, you should not hit too close,
because by that time, you're dead when you
battle a pro knife gamer. Nor
should you hit too far, since after a hit
your opponent has the chance to move a little
bit forward and hit you.

The question is, can a higher ping defeat a lower
ping, particularly too low ping? I've seen pro
gamers that constantly have a 4 ping rate.
In a direct attack battle, mostly you will not
win if you have a higher ping
but with a trick, you can still win.
Now my problem is that, what if you always
attack directly without a trick, can you still win?

The low ping has all the advantages because
he has no delay and the movement is really in real
time, while you with a higher ping will have a little
bit of delay, so mostly he will defeat you.
Now there are instances where a higher ping gamer
will still win the battle. In this case, a lot 
of questions are actually arising.

Will a gamer with a higher ping, with a perfect
timing, still hit correctly? Maybe yes.
I'm thinking in the code level of this game,
that when you reach the distance that you 
should hit and you hit it perfectly,
the code will still process this without
bias, whether the other one has a lower ping rate.
For example, in reality, it's just like hitting
a physical button when both players started
at the same time. 
But in online gaming, whether the other one
has a little bit of delay, the code will still
process it as who hit the button first, regardless
of the delay, the server will wait for both
hits and process it who hits first.

But this is still debatable. Other maps, like
fight yard, gun game, sniper etc., 
in my experience, even
with 200+ ping rate, I can still win the battle
against lower ping rate provided
it's not lagging. It's just that, knife map
is quite a unique situation.

But of course, this is mostly theoretical
discussion. If you are a gamer, you should have
the lowest possible ping rate.

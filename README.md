# Ping | Bandwidth | Internet Speed
When I had my first stable Internet connection at home, I 
was so satisfied by the loading speed
every time I watched YouTube videos.
There is almost no lag and the download speed is more than
25+ MBPS. And then came the high demanding game: the online
Counter Strike. Casual games are no problem but
when a split-second fast action game is what you want,
you need to optimize everything, particularly your latency.

My company too has a great
and dedicated Internet connection but when I tested
it also with the online Counter Strike, things
were not that simple. I asked myself why I'm having
a very high ping when the Internet speed in
my workplace is more than 50MBPS most of the time?

So I really need to have that answer. 
And now I have the answer.

## Internet Speed
First of all, you know that when you just want
a quality experience watching YouTube videos
or NetFlix, all you need is a fast connection, right?

That's true. My connection here is a 25MBPS subscription.
It's not pure fiber, so download speed is far more
ahead of the upload speed. But that's just okay.
I have my online class and things have been okay
for several months.

I was not noticing the importance of other factors,
until I played online Counter Strike.
So again, for just browsing and regular connection,
just knowing the Internet speed is enough. More
than 25MBPS download speed plus 5MBPS upload speed
is really fast one.

## Bandwidth
Bandwidth is when you think of the volume passing
through your connection: think of a road.
The more lanes it has, the more vehicles can pass
through at a given time.

So here is the catch: no matter how fast is 
your speed connection, say, your modem is being
used by so many people, it can only transmit
the maximum data it can handle. So it will 
result in a clogged network when it can't handle
all the demanding uploads and downloads.

This clogging will affect your latency
because no matter how fast your connection is,
if it's clogged, then you can send and receive
data in real time, it will increase your latency.

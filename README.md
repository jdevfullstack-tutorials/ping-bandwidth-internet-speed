# Ping | Bandwidth | Internet Speed
When I had my first stable Internet connection at home, I 
was so satisfied by the loading speed
every time I watched YouTube videos.
There is almost no lag and the download speed is more than
25+ MBPS. And then came the high demanding game: the online
Counter Strike. Casual games are no problem but
when a split-second fast action game is what you want,
you need to optimize everything, particularly your latency.

My company too has a great
and dedicated Internet connection but when I tested
it also with the online Counter Strike, things
were not that simple. I asked myself why I'm having
a very high ping when the Internet speed in
my workplace is more than 50MBPS most of the time?

So I really need to have that answer. 
And now I have the answer.

## Internet Speed
First of all, you know that when you just want
a quality experience watching YouTube videos
or NetFlix, all you need is a fast connection, right?

That's true. My connection here is a 25MBPS subscription.
It's not pure fiber, so download speed is far more
ahead of the upload speed. But that's just okay.
I have my online class and things have been okay
for several months.

I was not noticing the importance of other factors,
until I played online Counter Strike.
So again, for just browsing and regular connection,
just knowing the Internet speed is enough. More
than 25MBPS download speed plus 5MBPS upload speed
is a really fast one.

## Bandwidth
Bandwidth is when you think of the volume passing
through your connection: think of a road.
The more lanes it has, the more vehicles can pass
through at a given time.

So here is the catch: no matter how fast is 
your speed connection, say, your modem is being
used by so many people, it can only transmit
the maximum data it can handle. So it will 
result in a clogged network when it can't handle
all the demanding uploads and downloads.

This clogging will affect your latency
because no matter how fast your connection is,
if it's clogged, then you can send and receive
data in real time, it will increase your latency.


## Ping / Latency
Latency is how long (duration in milleseconds)
data sent will return to the device that initiated the ping.
Ping is the signal sent. In gaming, since, ping
is a shorter term, mostly it will be used,
but the complete term is ping rate / latency.

At this point, several factors are involved. You 
can have a good ping but still you lag in
your fast action game. Conversely, you can have 200+ ping
but you don't experience any lag. All of these things
I experienced when playing CS online. And I 
was wondering why because my connection is so fast.

One is the quality of connection. You know, even if it
is fast, sometimes it's being shared by all users
in your home or all users at your certain area.
Another one here is network traffic, most of the time
when I'm testing in incognito a random search and
recaptcha appears, I know my connection is distorted.
At this point, data sent and received in my real time 
game will also be distorted, causing lagging. 

Another one is the connection itself. No matter how
fast is your Wi Fi technology, still interference
will be there from time to time. Whenever I'm lagging
severely, I'm checking whether the Wi Fi connection
is full bar or not, and most of the time, it's not.
If it goes back to full bar, I still lag because
my connection is now fluctuating. So better
use a cable, not necessarily the latest one, but
cat7 will do.

Also, as we all know, geographical location is very
important. For example, Malaysia and Singapore
are closer to one another than the Philippines.
This causes better ping for Malaysia and Singapore
players than the Philippines, now matter how good
the connection is in the Philippines. This was
proven by the CS Online where the servers are
located at Singapore.

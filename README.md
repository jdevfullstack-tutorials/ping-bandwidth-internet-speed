# Ping | Bandwidth | Internet Speed
When I had my first stable Internet connection at home, I 
was so satisfied by the loading speed
everytime I watched YouTube videos.
There is almost no lag and the download speed is more than
25+ MBPS. And then came the high demanding game: the online
Counter Strike. Casual games are no problem but
when a split-second fast action game is what you want,
you need to optimize everything, particularly your latency.

My company too has a great
and dedicated Internet connection but when I tested
it also with the online Counter Strike, things
were not that simple. I asked myself why I'm having
a very high ping when the Internet speed in
my workplace is more than 50MBPS most of the time?

So I really need to have that answer. 
And now I have the answer.

## Internet Speed

## Bandwidth

## Ping / Latency
